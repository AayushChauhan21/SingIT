# SingIT
> From Shower Singer to Stage Singer❤️‍🔥

SingIT is an Android app made for anyone who loves to sing. It’s designed to be a creative space where you can play around with tracks and sync your voice in real-time, basically turning your phone into a portable karaoke machine.

### Project Overview
The app lets you interact with music using three different audio modes. You can easily switch between them to get the exact sound you want:

* **Original Audio:** Play the full song with lyrics that move in time with the music.
* **Vocal Integration:** Record your own voice while you sing along.
* **Instrumental Mode:** Standard karaoke style with just the backing tracks.

The best part is the custom sound bar controller. It lets you mix and switch between these modes smoothly while the song is playing.

### Development Objectives
* **User-Friendly Design:** A simple and responsive Android interface that keeps up with the music.
* **Smart Recording:** Let users record their vocals directly over instrumental tracks.
* **Smooth Mixing:** A custom-built controller to change audio modes on the fly.
* **Safe & Private:** Standard login and profile management to keep user data secure.
* **Lyric Sync:** Making sure the lyrics show up at the exact right moment.
