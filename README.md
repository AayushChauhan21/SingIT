# 🎤 SingIT: Interactive Karaoke Experience  
> “Where every vocal finds its music!”

## 📱 Overview  
SingIT is an Android-based music application that offers a dynamic karaoke experience. It allows users to interact with songs in three distinct modes:
- 🎧 Original track with synchronized lyrics

A custom sound bar enables smooth switching and blending between these modes, enhancing user engagement and musical creativity.
